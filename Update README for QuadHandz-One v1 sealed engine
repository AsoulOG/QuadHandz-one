QuadHandz-One — v1 Sealed Engine for the Quadnition Protocol

Author: Angelo F. Quintos
Status: Immutable Provenance Archive (v1)
Timestamp: Verified via OpenTimestamps

⸻

Overview

QuadHandz-One is the first machine-layer engine of the Quadnition Protocol, a zero-PII, deterministic, cryptographically-verifiable system for validating human-machine origin across four domains:
	1.	Intent (Thought) — LGA / GlowCheck challenge-response
	2.	Time (Sound) — Temporal micro-dither carrier
	3.	Form (Image) — SealWeave indelible watermark
	4.	Record (Machine) — Micro-Seal HMAC-chained forensic logs

This repo archives the sealed v1 engine, along with verification steps and provenance guarantees.

Architecture Summary

QuadHandz-One performs four functions:

1. Intent Verification (LGA / GlowCheck)
	•	Determines “human-in-the-loop” authenticity
	•	Uses mathematically-bound challenges
	•	Ensures content wasn’t pre-generated, pre-planted, or synthetic

2. Temporal Continuity (Micro-Dither Carrier)
	•	Binds events to real time and frame index
	•	Prevents retroactive edits or sequence manipulation

3. Indelible Image/Media Marking (SealWeave™)
	•	Multi-carrier watermark
	•	Survives recompression, re-encode, screenshot, screen-record
	•	Tamper attempts leave detectable scars

4. Machine-Layer Log Seal (Micro-Seal)
	•	HMAC-chained record of actions
	•	Zero PII
	•	Non-repudiable, tamper-evident, auditor-verifiable

Verification Steps
	1.	Download the .pdf and .ots timestamp files
	2.	Visit https://opentimestamps.org
	3.	Upload the .ots file
	4.	Verify the anchored hash matches the repo-included hash manifest
	5.	Confirm unchanged file integrity via Merkle-v2 verifier
